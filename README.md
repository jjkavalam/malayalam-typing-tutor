# malayalam-typing-tutor
A simple typing tutor for Malayalam Inscript

## Usage
1. Download the project
2. Open index.html in the browser
3. Switch to Malayalam keyboard on your operating system
4. Follow onscreen instructions and learn typing !

## Enable Malayalam input
The support for Malayalam input in recent releases of Windows / Ubuntu etc. is very good. In fact no extra installation is needed. To enable Malayalam input you just need to add Malayalam keyboard using an appropriate system setting (Please Google for this if you are in doubt).

After that you can switch the keyboard to Malayalam or other languages by using the "Window + Space" key.

## About this project
This is a simplistic typing tutor meant specifically for Malayalam Inscript in that, when "matras" are input they are joined to the last letter.

In any case, please feel free to use the code or its ideas. If you are interested in extending this you may fork the project or raise a merge request. I welcome bug reports too. Create a new "Issue" if you have one.
